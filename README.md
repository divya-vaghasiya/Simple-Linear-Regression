# Simple Linear Regression - Predicting Package Based on CGPA

The notebook seems to involve implementing a simple linear regression model with a dataset, and visualizing the results using matplotlib for scatter plots. Based on this, I will create a README file that describes the project, Hereâ€™s a sample README:


**Project Overview**<br>
In this project, we use a simple linear regression algorithm to model the relationship between CGPA and the expected salary package (in LPA - Lakhs Per Annum). The project includes the following steps:

**Data Import and Preprocessing**: Loading and preparing the data for model training.</br>
**Model Implementation**: Applying the Simple Linear Regression model.</br>
**Data Visualization**: Plotting the relationship between CGPA and the salary package using matplotlib.</br>

**Requirements**</br>
Python 3.x</br>
numpy</br>
pandas</br>
matplotlib</br>
sklearn</br>

**Example Output**</br>
The notebook includes scatter plots to visualize the data and the regression line predicting the salary package based on CGPA.
